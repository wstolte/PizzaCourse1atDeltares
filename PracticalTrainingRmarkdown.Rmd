## Start a new Rmarkdown document

* In Rstudio, choose from file menu: New File / R Markdown...
* Determine what kind of document you want it to be
    + for this training, choose "pdf"
    Note that you can also choose a presentation, which changes the choices of the formats that it can handle
* The document opens with some standard, functional, content to get going
* Note that the document contains both "normal" text (which actually is Markdown text) combined with 'chunks' of R code (the grey pieces)
* Try and run the document by pressing the "Knit PDF" button just above the document in Rstudio
    + a pdf document appears in which the Rmarkdown + R code is combined to a single document.
